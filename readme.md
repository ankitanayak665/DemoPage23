Prerequisites:
There are two separate folders for client side and server side files.
So you need to install all packages needed separately in both the folders.

To run server:
You need to open two different terminals to run these two different folders(client and server).
Once the server has started and you got connected to your database open the provided port number for client side in one tab and in another tab for the server side in your browser.
